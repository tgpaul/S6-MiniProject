                <li>Always Test Your Blood Sugar</li>
                <p class = "tip_text">One of the most important ways to avoid complications is to keep your blood sugar under control. It means testing your blood sugar regularly and ensuring it stays within your target range.
                    Your target blood sugar range will differ depending on your type of diabetes and treatment plan. Know how to test, the right time, and what your target blood sugar levels should be. </p>
                <li>See Your Doctor Regularly</li>
                <p class = "tip_text">If you have diabetes, see your doctor regularly for checkups. Doing so ensures that your diabetes is manageable and you’re not at risk of complications. Get your A1C checked at least twice a year to measure your average blood sugar over the past few months.</p>
                <li>Monitor Your Blood Pressure</li>
                <p class = "tip_text">High blood pressure is a common complication of diabetes. It can damage your heart, kidneys, and other organs. Ensure your blood pressure is checked at least once every year to avoid this complication. If it is high, work with your healthcare team to lower it. Be sure to follow your blood pressure medication regimen and lifestyle modifications prescribed by the doctor.</p>
                <li>Manage Stress</li>
                <p class = "tip_text">Stress can raise your blood sugar levels, but you can find ways to manage it. It may include relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, or counseling. Stress can also lead to unhealthy behaviors such as overeating or not taking your diabetes medications. Exercising, spending time with friends and family, and journaling are great ways to manage stress.</p>
                <li>Protect Your Feet</li>
                <p class = "tip_text">Diabetes can cause nerve damage and poor blood flow to your feet, leading to problems like foot ulcers. Inspect your feet for cuts, blisters, or redness every day to avoid these complications. In addition, be sure to wash your feet every day and dry them well. Wear shoes that fit correctly and protect your feet from injury. If you have any problems with your feet, see a podiatrist right away.</p>
